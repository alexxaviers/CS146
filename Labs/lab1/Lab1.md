For the problem, the Hash map data structure is used. While iterating through the array, 
we check if the complement of the number in the array is a key in the hash map. If it is then that means there
is another number when added to the the original equals the target. If the key does not exist in the hash map, 
we add the number as the key points to its index value so we can return that value if the key is found.
