In class, we briefly discussed that Merge Sort was stable, and Quick Sort is unstable.
Why would this property be useful? Is there an issue if this property does not hold good for a sorting algorithm?
You can just type in your answer here, or choose to submit a GitHub link in case you want richer diagrams/ visualizations. 


A stable algorithm is useful because it means that if values are equal in the data set, they would not be swapped around.
This is not the case for an unstable algorithm, however. When these elements swap around, it increases time complexity
and the chance for errors, leading to unexpected behavior. For instance, if you sort a list of objects with one stable
sorting algorithm and then again, but this time with an unstable sorting algorithm, the original order from the first
iteration may not be preserved.
