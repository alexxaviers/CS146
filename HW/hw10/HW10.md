```
In order to print the tree in a level order, I used a queue that will start with the tree's root, which the method takes in as a parameter. I then use a while loop that will continue until the queue is empty. Within the while loop, we simply add the left or right nodes if they exist and then change the current node to the next head of the queue. The real challenge is how to add the nodes to the list correctly. Within the while loop, we also have a current-level list. This current level will consist of all the nodes in that level, and then add that list to the main list we will return to the user. We find the queue size to know how many nodes we need to put in this current level list since that would be how many nodes are in that level. This is because we visit all the children of a node before exploring them all, so our queue always consists of one of the levels of the tree.
