For the problem, I first put the word in lowercase. I also initialized a reverse variable, which contains an empty string.
I then iterated through the word, character by character, but in reverse, with a for loop, and put each character in the empty string. 
This resulted in the reverse of the word being placed into the empty string.
Afterward, I compare the original word and the reverse string with the .equals() method.
