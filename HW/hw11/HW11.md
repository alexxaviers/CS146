```
In order to solve the problem, I used a recursive fill method.
This method is first called the floodFill method. The floodFill method
serves as the entry point for the algorithm. It checks if the starting pixel (image[sr][sc])
if it already has the new color. If it does, the method returns the original image immediately,
so we don't waste time. If the starting pixel does not have the new color, the method calls the
 fill method to perform the flood fill operation. The fill method is the main part of this algorithm
since it is were the main recursion takes place. It first checks if the current coordinates are
within the image bounds and if the pixel at that position has the original color. If these
 conditions are met, then we check if the pixel color is changed to the new color, and the
method recursively calls itself for neighboring pixels. We continue this until all pixels
connected to the original color are changed to the new color recursively. I have also included
a print method so we are able to see the image before and after for testing purposes.
