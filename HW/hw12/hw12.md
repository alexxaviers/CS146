```
For the minCostToSupplyWater Method, I created a list to store the costs
of building wells and laying pipes. We add the costs of building wells and
laying pipes using a loop to the list. We then sort the list in ascending
order based on the cost of each edge, which is a well or pipe. We also have
a variable min to store the minimum total cost. Using the disjoint set from the
 collections I imported, we iterate through the coss and check if the houses
connected by the current edge belong to the same set. If not, it updates the
 minimum cost and merges the sets using the UnionFind object's union method.
 We then decrement n, which is the number of houses, and check if all the houses
are connected. If so, it returns the minimum cost and, finally, the final minimum cost.
